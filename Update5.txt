(1) your team's project progress made in the past week and explain whether that's in line with the milestones you have made in your project proposal; 

Iterative Improvement: Make necessary adjustments based on feedback and test results.
Final Deployment: Launch the enhanced bandwidth allocation system for regular use.
Documentation: Draft a comprehensive guide detailing the system's functionality, user guidelines, and maintenance procedures.


progress: Iterative Improvement(Machine Learning Model), and Final Deployment(NS-3)finished. Draft the comprehensive guide detailing the system's functionality is still in progress.


(2) Each team member's contribution in the past week. We will also casually check your source code updates. 

Yichong's contribution: 
（a）Scenario-1 Deployment(NS-3): Constructed NS-3 file parameters to simulate scenarios-1, random in-experiment: Random devices use devices for a random period of time
（b）Scenario-2 Deployment(NS-3)：Constructed the the bandwidth allocation simulator environment on NS-3 according for Contrast Experimental scenario2, according the Machinne Learning prediction result.

Ping Zhang's contribution: 
（a）Make necessary adjustments on the Contrast Experiments parameters set up based on feedback and test results.
（b）Draft experimental reports, tables and results.
