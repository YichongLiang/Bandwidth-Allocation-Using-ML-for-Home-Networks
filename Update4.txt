(1) your team's project progress made in the past week and explain whether that's in line with the milestones you have made in your project proposal; 

Model Testing: Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.
Optimization: Fine-tune the model based on validation results.
System Integration: Incorporate the trained model into the network management system for bandwidth allocation.

Procedure Adjustment: After analysis, we have fouonded that a network management system for bandwidth allocation is not needed. Instead, after analyzing the output of the machine learning model, we will manually construct the NS-3 file parameters based on the analysis results to simulate according to the experimental scenarios.


(2) Each team member's contribution in the past week. We will also casually check your source code updates.
